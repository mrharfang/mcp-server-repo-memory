# üß† Project Memory MCP Server

> **Enhanced repository intelligence through persistent semantic memory**

A specialized fork of [mcp-server-tree-sitter](https://github.com/wrale/mcp-server-tree-sitter) that adds **intelligent project memory capabilities** using ChromaDB vector embeddings. This MCP server enables AI assistants to build and maintain a deep understanding of codebases across sessions, providing contextual awareness and semantic search at scale.

## üéØ Why Project Memory?

Traditional code analysis tools parse and forget. **Project Memory MCP** remembers, learns, and builds context over time. When working with large codebases, AI assistants need more than syntax trees‚Äîthey need **semantic understanding** of how code components relate, evolve, and function together.

### The Problem We Solved
- **Context Loss**: AI assistants lose project understanding between sessions
- **Scale Limitations**: Large codebases overwhelm context windows
- **Surface-Level Analysis**: Syntax parsing without semantic relationships
- **Repetitive Discovery**: Re-learning the same codebase patterns repeatedly

### Our Solution
- **üß† Persistent Memory**: ChromaDB vector storage maintains project understanding across sessions
- **üîç Semantic Search**: Find code by intent and meaning, not just keywords
- **üìä Relationship Mapping**: Understand how code components connect and interact
- **‚ö° Intelligent Indexing**: Efficient processing of large codebases with smart caching

## üöÄ How ChromaDB Transforms Code Understanding

[ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/) is a vector database designed for AI applications. We use it to create **semantic embeddings** of your code, enabling:

### **Semantic Code Search**
```python
# Instead of searching for exact strings...
find_text("authentication logic")

# Find code by meaning and intent
memory_search("user login validation and session management")
```

### **Intelligent Context Retrieval**
```python
# Get related code automatically
memory_query("database connection patterns") 
# Returns: connection pools, transaction handlers, ORM usage, etc.
```

### **Cross-Session Learning**
- **Session 1**: Analyze authentication system
- **Session 2**: AI remembers previous analysis when working on authorization
- **Session 3**: Builds on understanding for security audit

## üìã Quick Start Examples

### 1. Index Your Project
```python
# Register and build memory for your codebase
register_project("/path/to/your/project", "my-web-app")
index_project_memory("my-web-app")
```

### 2. Semantic Code Discovery
```python
# Find authentication-related code
results = query_project_memory(
    project="my-web-app",
    query="user authentication and password validation",
    limit=10
)
```

### 3. Intelligent Context Building
```python
# Get comprehensive project overview
context = list_project_memories("my-web-app")
# Returns: Key components, patterns, architecture insights
```

## üõ† Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- ChromaDB and sentence-transformers (managed via `uv`)

### Installation
```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd mcp-server-repo-memory
uv sync  # Installs all dependencies including ChromaDB
```

### Claude Desktop Configuration
Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "project_memory": {
            "command": "uv",
            "args": [
                "--directory", "/absolute/path/to/mcp-server-repo-memory",
                "run", "-m", "mcp_server_tree_sitter.server"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
