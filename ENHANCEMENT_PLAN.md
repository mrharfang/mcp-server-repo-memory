# MCP Repo Memory Enhancement Plan

## Overview
This document tracks the enhancement plan for transforming the mcp-server-tree-sitter project into a comprehensive repo memory and code intelligence system.

## Milestone Progress

### Milestone 1: Project Setup and Identity âœ… COMPLETE
**Goal**: Establish project foundation with proper identity, dependencies, and baseline functionality.

**Checklist**:
- [x] Fork and rename repository to `mcp-server-repo-memory`
- [x] Clone repository to local development environment
- [x] Update project identity in `pyproject.toml`:
  - [x] Change name to "mcp-server-repo-memory"
  - [x] Update description to reflect enhanced capabilities
  - [x] Add Rick Barraza as contributor
- [x] Install all project dependencies using `uv sync`
- [x] Install development dependencies using `uv sync --extra dev`
- [x] Verify project builds and dependencies resolve
- [x] Run baseline test suite (`uv run pytest`) - all 217 tests pass
- [x] Create this enhancement plan document
- [x] Update README.md header to reflect new project identity

**Status**: âœ… Complete
**Completion Date**: Current
**Notes**: 
- Project successfully adapted from Node.js/npm to Python/uv environment
- All dependencies installed and tests passing
- Project identity updated to reflect repo memory-enhanced capabilities

### Milestone 2: Memory Infrastructure âœ… COMPLETE
**Goal**: Implement core memory services for embedding generation, vector storage, and semantic chunking.

**Completed Features**:
- [x] EmbeddingService with mock backend for text embedding generation
- [x] ProjectMemory service with ChromaDB integration for vector storage
- [x] Semantic chunking and code analysis capabilities
- [x] MemoryConfig integration with existing configuration system
- [x] Dependency injection (DI) container integration for memory services
- [x] Type definitions for memory-related data structures
- [x] Comprehensive test suite verifying all memory infrastructure

**Key Files Implemented**:
- `src/mcp_server_tree_sitter/services/embedding_service.py` - Text embedding generation
- `src/mcp_server_tree_sitter/services/project_memory.py` - Vector storage and retrieval
- `src/mcp_server_tree_sitter/types/memory.py` - Memory type definitions
- Extended `config.py` and `di.py` for memory integration
- `test_milestone_2.py` - Comprehensive verification tests

**Status**: âœ… Complete
**Completion Date**: 2025-06-03
**Notes**: 
- All memory infrastructure components are functional and tested
- ChromaDB integration working with proper metadata handling
- Mock embedding backend ready for future real model integration
- DI container properly provides memory services as singletons

### Milestone 3: MCP Tool Extensions âœ… COMPLETE
**Goal**: Implement MCP tools that expose project memory functionality to users.

**Completed Features**:
- [x] `index_project_memory` - Create or update semantic memory index for a codebase project
- [x] `query_project_memory` - Semantic search across indexed codebase using natural language 
- [x] `list_project_memories` - Show all indexed projects and their memory statistics
- [x] Integration with existing MCP server tool registration system
- [x] Proper async/sync bridge for memory service calls
- [x] Comprehensive testing and functional verification

**Key Files Implemented**:
- `src/mcp_server_tree_sitter/tools/memory_tools.py` - Memory tool implementations
- Extended `src/mcp_server_tree_sitter/tools/registration.py` for tool registration
- `test_milestone_3.py` - Verification tests
- `test_memory_tools_functional.py` - Functional flow tests

**Status**: âœ… Complete
**Completion Date**: 2025-06-03
**Notes**: 
- All three memory tools properly registered and functional
- Tools successfully bridge sync MCP framework with async memory services
- Full end-to-end testing from indexing to querying working
- Memory tools ready for real-world usage with existing MCP clients

### Milestone 4: Enhanced Memory Capabilities (NEXT)
**Goal**: Implement persistent memory and intelligent repo context tracking.

**Planned Features**:
- Persistent session memory across MCP interactions
- Intelligent repo context summarization
- Code relationship mapping and memory
- Enhanced search with semantic understanding
- Repo history and change tracking

**Status**: ðŸ”„ Pending

### Milestone 5: Advanced Intelligence Features (FUTURE)
**Goal**: Add sophisticated code analysis and project understanding capabilities.

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Planned

### Milestone 6: Integration and Optimization (FUTURE)
**Goal**: Optimize performance and integrate with development workflows.

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Planned

## Development Environment
