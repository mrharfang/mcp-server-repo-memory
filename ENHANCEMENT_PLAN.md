# MCP Repo Memory Enhancement Plan

## Overview
This document tracks the enhancement plan for transforming the mcp-server-tree-sitter project into a comprehensive repo memory and code intelligence system.

## Milestone Progress

### Milestone 1: Project Setup and Identity âœ… COMPLETE
**Goal**: Establish project foundation with proper identity, dependencies, and baseline functionality.

**Checklist**:
- [x] Fork and rename repository to `mcp-server-repo-memory`
- [x] Clone repository to local development environment
- [x] Update project identity in `pyproject.toml`:
  - [x] Change name to "mcp-server-repo-memory"
  - [x] Update description to reflect enhanced capabilities
  - [x] Add Rick Barraza as contributor
- [x] Install all project dependencies using `uv sync`
- [x] Install development dependencies using `uv sync --extra dev`
- [x] Verify project builds and dependencies resolve
- [x] Run baseline test suite (`uv run pytest`) - all 217 tests pass
- [x] Create this enhancement plan document
- [x] Update README.md header to reflect new project identity

**Status**: âœ… Complete
**Completion Date**: Current
**Notes**: 
- Project successfully adapted from Node.js/npm to Python/uv environment
- All dependencies installed and tests passing
- Project identity updated to reflect repo memory-enhanced capabilities

### Milestone 2: Enhanced Memory Capabilities (NEXT)
**Goal**: Implement persistent memory and intelligent repo context tracking.

**Planned Features**:
- Persistent session memory across MCP interactions
- Intelligent repo context summarization
- Code relationship mapping and memory
- Enhanced search with semantic understanding
- Repo history and change tracking

**Status**: ðŸ”„ Pending

### Milestone 3: Advanced Intelligence Features (FUTURE)
**Goal**: Add sophisticated code analysis and project understanding capabilities.

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Planned

### Milestone 4: Integration and Optimization (FUTURE)
**Goal**: Optimize performance and integrate with development workflows.

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Planned

## Development Environment
- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Package Manager**: uv
- **Testing Framework**: pytest

- **Base Framework**: Tree-sitter code analysis

## Getting Started
1. Ensure Python 3.10+ and uv are installed
2. Clone repository: `git clone <repo-url>`
3. Install dependencies: `uv sync`
4. Install dev dependencies: `uv sync --extra dev`
5. Run tests: `uv run pytest`
6. Start development server: `uv run python -m mcp_server_tree_sitter`
